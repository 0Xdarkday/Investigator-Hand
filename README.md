## Introduction to the Windows Registry Map for forensic investigations 

The Windows Registry is a hierarchical database that stores low-level settings for the operating system and applications. It is a critical component in managing system configurations, user preferences, and operational details such as files, folders, user profiles, and network settings. The Registry is divided into multiple root keys that contain numerous subkeys, values, and data used by Windows to manage both hardware and software.

This Registry map provides a visual and organized representation of important registry locations, categorized based on their relevance to files, folders, users, system, and network configurations. By understanding these key registry paths, administrators and cybersecurity professionals can efficiently monitor, investigate, and secure critical aspects of the system.

This map is divided into the following categories:

- Files and Folders: Tracks recently opened files, user-specific folders, and mounted devices.
- System Information: Stores key system details such as Windows version, computer name, and timezone.
- Network Information: Identifies network interfaces, physical cards, and connection history.
- User Information: Manages user profiles, last logon details, and user-specific settings.

Each section in the map highlights critical registry keys that can be used for system analysis, troubleshooting, and forensic investigations, helping to maintain control over system behavior and security.
